# PlantScape
iOS // Swift 3 // MapKit // Touch Drawing & Design Tools // USDA Plant Database

PlantScape was my capstone project for the iOS stack at Coding Dojo.  I plan to continue working on this project until users can use it to design small spaces in their backyards!

Check out the demo video to watch how the lastest version runs.
